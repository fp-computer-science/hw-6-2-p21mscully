### The Random Module

---

Answer each of the following questions in the same Python file named `hw6-2.py`. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. You will need the `random` module for this assignment so be sure to import it at the beginning of your file. Set the random seed to 16.

Each question should consist of 2 lines (except questions 9 and 10). The first line should be a comment with `Question #` where the `#` is the number of the question. The next line should print the use of a function of the module that completes the desired task.

*Example*

``` python
# Question 0
your answer to the question
```

1. Write a line of code that generates a random number between `30` and `50`, exclusive.

2. Write a line of code that generates a random even number between `2` and `75`, exclusive.

3. Write a line of code that generates a random odd number between `20` and `30`, inclusive.

4. Write a line of code that would simulate rolling a `8` sided dice.

5. Write a line of code that would simulate rolling a `20` sided dice.

6. Write a line of code that chooses a random element from the following sequence: `['cat', 'dog', 'sheep', 'cow', 'chicken', 'pig']`.

7. Write a line of code that selects 4 random numbers from the following sequence: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. Assume there is replacement.

8. Write a line of code that selects 5 random numbers from the following sequence: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Assume there is no replacement.

9. Write 3 lines of code that simulate shuffling a standard deck of playing cards. *Hint* Your first line will be this: `cards = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]`, your second line will use a function in the random library, and your third line will be a print statement.

10. Write 2 lines of code, one that sets the random seed to `1942`, and another that generates a random number between `1` and `1000` inclusive.
